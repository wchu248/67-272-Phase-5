		<h3>Frak.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a 500 Error.</h3>

    <p>We are sorry, but due to a <%= link_to "Cylon", "http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Cylons_(RDM)" %> 
        <%= link_to "virus", "http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Cylon_computer_virus" %> that has infected the 
        central computer system the page you are looking could not be generated. Once our systems have been 
        restored from a clean back-up, we will be able to spool up the 
        <%= link_to "FTL drive", "http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/FTL#Faster-Than-Light_travel" %> and make 
        the jump to a safer location.  Once the fleet is secure, you will be notified (the error has been logged) 
        and may try your request again at that time.</p>
    <p>So say we all.</p>
